* fix bug where `du -a Windows | du-view > ~/Desktop/usage.html` works fine but `du -a Windows/ | du-view > ~/Desktop/usage.html` outputs only a single row
* allow page up/page down to work. this could be done by generalizing getNextUpNode and getNextDownNode to take as input a number for how many entries to go up. Arrows would be 1 and page up/page down would be some higher number.

iterate hierarchy tree
----------------------
How to iterate thru hierarchy tree list that looks something like:

dir0
    dir1
        dir2
            dir4
                file5
                file6
            file1
            file2
        file7
    dir3
        file3
        file4
    file8

Essentially, just do a dfs search like:

iter(tree) {
    if (tree.children is empty) {
        return list with just element tree
    }

    list elems
    foreach c in tree.children { // in order
        elems.add(iter(c))
    }

    return elems
}
